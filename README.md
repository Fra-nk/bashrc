Shared bashrc
=============

Usage:

    git clone https://github.com/artus-analysis/bashrc.git
    cd ~
    ln -s /path/to/bashrc/default .bashrc

Instead of the last line, you can:

1. use your own `.bashrc` file and source the parts you like
2. create your own `username` file in this repository and
   link to it instead of linking to `default`.
